# Number game
let's design it

I want to create a number guessing game. 
As a user, i want to guess a number and have a response of whether it matches the random number or not. 

I will accept pseudo code or plain english sentences.

added difficulty - bigger range - incremental with correct guess


### What variables

request.body {new user attributes}

PUT
