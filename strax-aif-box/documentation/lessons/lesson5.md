## HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

### Client vs Server

- Clients are often browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari), but they can be any type of program or device.

- Servers are most often computers in the cloud.

### The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

### What is a HTTP Request/Response? 
Example: 
Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

1. A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
2. An web server receives the request
3. The server runs an application to process the request
4. The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
5. The client (the browser) receives the response
