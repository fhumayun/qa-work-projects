        'Request a new participant for a fidget

         - "loginId": email id for the participant,
         - "fidgetDocId": fidgetID,
         - "accessCode": access code for the participant to enroll against the fidget ID.

         A participant is invited to join the team for a specific fidget. The make request
         process involves providing the email address of the participant and an access-code.

         The invitee (participant) will need to be provided with the access-code via a
         separate channel out of groupcaretech.com by the account owner / primary.

         This method
           - creates a new participant, if the provided email-id is not in the system already.
           - adds the fidget into the array, if the participant exists in the system.

        Registration of participant happens when a new participant gets added to the
        system or an existing participant gets a request from a different fidget.

         Validates the access code assigned for the participant, specific to the fidget,
         - if the participant profile was already setup
         - then force the user to authenticate and register,
         - else allow the user to setup the profile.
